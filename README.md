**Electrum** simplifies framework-agnostic declaration of React components.
It is used internally by [Epsitec SA](https://github.com/epsitec-sa/) to
bridge the gap with its _Xcraft toolchain_ and with its _Lydia framework_.

# THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS

The implementation of `electrum` is being modified radically. Please
wait until version has stabilized.

# Where does the name Electrum come from?

[_Electrum_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrum) is an alloy of gold and
silver used to produce ancient [Lydian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia)
coinage.

> The first metal coins ever made, were of Electrum and date back to the end
> of the 7th century, beginning of the 6th century BC.
